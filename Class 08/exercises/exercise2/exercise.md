# Exercise 2 (Array destructuring)

In this exercise, we have two arrays: `studentSubjects` containing subjects and `studentGrades` containing corresponding grades. 

Use array destructuring to extract subjects and grades into separate variables (subject1, subject2, subject3, grade1, grade2, grade3). Then, we log each subject along with its corresponding grade to the console.

Expected output:
```
Subject 1: Math, Grade: 90
Subject 2: Science, Grade: 85
Subject 3: History, Grade: 95
```
