# Exercise 3

After user clicks on `Get Fact` button, there should be loaded fact in `fact-text` text, and image in `fact-img`.

API for fetching the fact text is: `https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com/`
API for fetching the image is: `https://random.dog/woof.json`

NOTE: Only if both - fact text and image are successfully fetched, we display both of them. If for ex. fetcing image fails, neither of them should be shown on the web page.

Use object destructuring and asynchronous functions where possible.
